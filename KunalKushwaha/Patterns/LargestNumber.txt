To find largest number between two or three or more numbers : 

METHOD 1 =>

Consider starting number b/w three numbers as maximum 
and using if else statemnts check is second and third digits are greater than max 
and assign that digit which is greater tham max 
and pronce checking finished to all digits print the max 

ex : - Largest b/w three numbers 
    > start
    > input a, b, c
    > let max = a;
    > if b > max
        max = b;
      else if c > max;
        max = c;
    > print max;
    > end  

METHOD 2 => Math.max function

ex :- Largest b/w three numbers 
    > start
    > input a, b, c
    > int max = Math.max(c,Math.max(a, b));
    > print (max);
    > end
